Looking down at the city below, I saw.

The lights, the people, the songs, the dancing, the joy.

All reminded me of that day.

"One day, I will become the Hero, and I will travel the world helping people!"

"Then, when that day comes, I'll come with you and be your comrade!"

"Then together we will be invincible!"

Now my vision travelled upwards.

In the sky I could see the stars, shining up above as they always have been.

All a sudden however, it had begun.

>transição pra imagem com a chuva de meteoros

Streaks of light started moving through the sky at high speeds. First it was only one, then another, then five more. In a matter of seconds, the sky was covered in streaking paths of light.

The meteor shower that happened every 10 years had started again.

That same meteor shower had, 10 years ago, been the symbol of the promise we made that day.

Now, 10 years later, I couldnt help but think it looked much more ominous.
